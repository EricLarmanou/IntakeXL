Air intake for high flow rate


This is a 3d model of the air intake I use for LGR gas analyzers.
It it directly inspired from the licor intake and upscalled to cope with the higher flow rate of the LGR. 3/8" tubing can fit in.
It is recommmended to add a mesh to prevent big objects like insects to get into the line.
